		<div class="bio-text">
			<p>Dr. Mahesh Lal Maskey is a computational hydrologist whose career bridges quantitative fieldwork, advanced modeling, and real-world solutions to pressing water challenges. Trained in civil engineering  from Pulchowk Campus, Institute of Engineering, Tribhuwan University, in Nepal, Dr. Maskey’s early work laid the foundation for a lifelong commitment to integrating hydrologic theory with applied research. His journey led him from hydroinformatics at UNESCO-IHE, Institute for Water Education in Delft, the Netherlands to a Ph.D. in Hydrology at the University of California, Davis, where he specialized in fractal-multifractal modeling and the geometric complexity of environmental systems.</p>

			<p>Across roles at UC Davis, UC Merced, and the United States Department of Agriculure Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS), Dr. Maskey has led and contributed to interdisciplinary teams addressing the water-climate nexus. His research spans field-based measurements, machine learning, and high-performance computing—advancing surface and groundwater modeling, climate impact assessments, and hydroeconomic frameworks that directly inform agricultural and water resource management. Notably, his leadership at the Sustainable Water Management Research Unit and National Center for Alluvial Aquifer Research (NCAAR) has produced actionable insights for conservation, irrigation scheduling, and sustainable aquifer management in the Mississippi Delta and beyond.</p>

			<p>Dr. Maskey’s philosophy centers on open, collaborative science. He is committed to developing transparent, reproducible workflows and open-source modeling tools, empowering researchers, students, and stakeholders. Through mentoring, guest lectures, and technical workshops, he has supported the next generation of scientists while building field-to-model pipelines that bridge theory, computation, and stakeholder engagement.</p>

			<p>Dr. Maskey’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is rooted in his own lived experience—growing up in Nepal’s Newari community and later navigating new barriers as an international scholar in the U.S. He has mentored over 50 students from a range of backgrounds, including first-generation college students, women, and international students, focusing on building technical skills while respecting each person’s identity and journey. His research aims to support fairness by addressing water challenges faced by underserved communities, such as collaborating with environmental justice groups in California and designing practical tools for resource-limited farmers in the Mississippi Delta. Dr. Maskey values honest dialogue, inclusive teaching, and community-engaged science, always striving to ensure that all voices are heard and that research connects directly with community needs. He has actively served on diversity and inclusion committees, organized equity-focused events, and plans to continue strengthening DEI efforts in all aspects of his academic and scientific work.</p>

			<p>Dr. Maskey believes in teaching through real-world, hands-on experiences and open collaboration, so that every student—no matter their background—can see how science makes a difference. He’s committed to helping students grow as practical problem-solvers and ethical leaders who are ready to tackle water challenges and serve their communities.</p>

			<p>Today, Dr. Maskey’s work focuses on transcending the limits of classical hydrologic modeling—integrating uncertainty analysis, machine learning, and stakeholder priorities to address complex water challenges under a changing climate. His vision is to catalyze systems that are reliable, adaptable, and equitable—serving both scientific discovery and community resilience.</p
